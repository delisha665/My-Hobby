        <p class="para">My hobby is reading. I love to read books in my free time. I feel that reading is a great hobby. Apart from giving pleasure, it also enhances our knowledge. Reading is very beneficial as well as an essential activity that helps in skill-building. Reading a good book gives us joy as well as it also gives the experience to live life smoothly. One of the best benefits of reading books is, it enriches our vocabulary with so many good words. It also benefits us with ideas collection, makes us familiar with different types of writing formats, helps us in improving our communication skills, and also makes it fluent.
            I love to red Dr.Dollitle,Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter
